	<p id="article">Lego makes some of the most delightful advertising around, and this series of print ads from <br>Ogilvy Bangkok are just about perfect, from concept to execution. The work, which won three <br> silver Lions (in Print and Publishing and Outdoor) and a bronze (in Design) at the Cannes festival <br>last month, shows kids literally envisioning their future careers by building them from the inside<br> with Legos.<br> <br>The tagline: “Build the future.”<br><br>“Lego’s ultimate purpose is to inspire and develop<br> children to think creatively, reason systematically and release their potential to shape their own <br>future. The brand believes that play is a key element in children’s growth and development. <br>High-quality play enriches a child’s life and lays a strong foundation for adult life,” Ogilvy Thailand <br>vice chairman Nopadol Srikieatikajohn tells AdFreak.“To communicate the brand belief, we<br> created this ad series to visualize the idea to consumers. We utilize the visual of a kid building with <br>Lego bricks in the shape of his or her dream career. The Lego bricks that are being built symbolize <br>the kids’ development, which gradually grows bigger and closer to their dream future.” The agency <br>called on Illusion in Bangkok to create the pieces using 3-D illustration.
